# Weather-Map-API-Postman-Testing
i perform one project recently based on API Automation Testing using Postman 
Using Postman, Create a request that sends a GET request to the open weather map API 
Here's the API URL:
https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6 907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22.

Requirements
1) Create an assertion to verify the latitude is 51.51 and the longitute is -0.13
2) In addition to asserting the latitude and longitute, please develop 3 more test cases you can test using the open weather API using Postman
3) Place the 4 request into a collection and export the collection as a JSON file
